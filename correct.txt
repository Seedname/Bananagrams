But, how would a person solve the message not knowing the key? Solving
the message not knowing the key is called cryptanalysis. Cryptanalysts
take up the "implied challenged to the ingenuity" that is tossed down by
secret writing, and they find, when successful, satisfaction of their "not
uncommon desire to discover a secret."
If the cryptanalyst knew that the method of encryption were simple
substitution cipher, then the cryptanalyst could try all possible keys to solve
the message. Or, maybe not! How many keys are possible? How long
would it take to try them all?
Ok, so it is not a good idea to try to solve one of these by brute force.
